# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello there! I'm Tirtsa, a software engineering student in my final year of BSc, with a deep passion for development, particularly in Java and C#. I have a keen interest in fullstack development and recently completed a comprehensive course covering various aspects of fullstack development, along with multiple hands-on projects.

## About Me
- 📊 I have a specialization in data science because I am fascinated by the world of data. Previously, I worked for two years as a data analyst at the Israeli Employment Service, where I developed a deep appreciation for leveraging data to derive meaningful insights.
- 🌱 Recently, I delved into fullstack development, where I explored frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, alongside backend technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and relational databases like MySQL.
- 💻 I enjoy problem-solving and creating efficient solutions using Java and C# for backend development.
- 🤖 I am enthusiastic about machine learning and its applications, continually exploring new techniques and algorithms.
